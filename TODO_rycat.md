# Deploy-Setup Project TODO

## Overview
A comprehensive deployment setup tool for After Dark Systems that automates infrastructure provisioning and application deployment.

## Core Functionality Needed
- [ ] Project initialization and configuration
- [ ] Cloud provider selection (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code generation (Terraform)
- [ ] Configuration management (Ansible)
- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] Secrets management and tagging
- [ ] Permission auditing

## Script Architecture
Main script should:
1. Parse command line arguments
2. Detect project type (node, python, php, etc.)
3. Generate appropriate infrastructure configurations
4. Create deployment playbooks
5. Handle secrets and security
6. Provide deployment commands

## Infrastructure Components
- [ ] VPC and networking setup
- [ ] EC2 instances or ECS containers
- [ ] RDS database instances
- [ ] S3 buckets for storage
- [ ] Load balancers (ELB/ALB)
- [ ] Security groups and IAM roles

## Configuration Management
- [ ] Server provisioning with Ansible
- [ ] Application deployment
- [ ] Service management
- [ ] Security hardening

## Next Steps
1. Implement main deploy-setup script using lib/utils.sh functions
2. Add interactive project setup wizard
3. Generate complete infrastructure configurations
4. Create deployment automation workflows
5. Add monitoring and logging setup
